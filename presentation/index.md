### Our plot for today

**First Act**: The First S Curve - Traditional Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning for Drug Repurposing

**Second Act**: Transition - The Need for a Paradigm Shift

**Third Act**: Foundation Models stealing the show 

**Fourth Act**: The place of Knowledge Graphs in the Future

## 1990+: Low Hanging Fruit are running out

![bg right](./assets/orchard.jpg)

Drug Discovery is becoming ever more difficult
- R&D costs soaring
- New drugs not keeping pace

Same time: Data availability explosion

- Electronic records
- growing body of scientific literature
- Genomics & Imaging data
- Wearables

What if we could use this data ðŸ¤”


---
## 1990 - 2010: Silos of Knowledge being built up

- Various domains building up their data domains
- Connectivity between them mostly missing
- Progress is made but unified view lacking

<!--
- Pharma companies are massively investing across their entire lifecycle
- Large amounts of data are generated
- However as with all large enterprises, data is siloed
- Pharma is particularly plagued by low collaboration due to sensitivity of data

## 2010s: Traditional Knowledge Graphs: Early Wins

- Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as specialized databases unifying data across domains
- Connect entities: diseases, genes, proteins, drugs
- Early examples:
  - [Hetionet](http://neo4j.het.io/browser/): Integration of multiple biomedical databases
  - [OpenBioLink](https://openbiolink.github.io/): Integration of multiple biomedical databases
  - [RTX](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/765305v2.full.pdf): Integration of multiple biomedical databases

<!-- 
Open Hetionet and show

## Arrival of Specialized Knowledge Graphs

- [SPOKE](https://spoke.ucsf.edu): Focusing on high curation quality
- [GARD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33183351/): Designed for rare diseases
- [RTX KG2](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2): Prioritizing number of sources and data categories ingested
- [PRIME](https://github.com/mims-harvard/PrimeKG): Leveraging Embedding distances for clique merging
- ...

### There is a lot of work being done but somehow this still feels like a _breadth first search_

We are not really getting closer to actual patient impact

## Act 2: The Transition
### KGs provide a great scaffold but their creation is still painfully manual

![bg right fit](assets/double_s_curve.excalidraw.svg)

---
## Problem 1: Everyone copies from the same places
![bg right fit](./assets/sankey.png)

- KGs need to ingest existing data, often from the same sources
- However, how data is ingested differs greatly 
- So if more is not always better and ingest does not = ingest
- How about unifying standards?



---
 
## Problem 2: KGs are distinct so we need IDs

But IDs require someone to hand them out

- We originate from a siloed world
- each domain already had its own ID systems
- now also KGs have their own ontology systems

## Problem 3: KGs struggle encoding continous data


<section class="hbox">	
<div class="container"> <div class="col" data-markdown> 
<ul>
<li>KGs excel at encoding relationships and networks</li>
<li>But a living organism is a messy continuous space</li>
<li>Not easy to encode without losing too much information</li>
</ul>

## Act 3: The Rise of Foundation Models
### Because really all we need is...

## Language models are being proposed at every step of the process

## Initial successes leveraging LLMs but the KG representation of information remains

- Merging equivalent nodes: PRIME KG uses BERT based cosine similarity to merge nodes
- Verifying drug-disease predictions: LLMs have helped verify predictions by collecting evidence from text
- Generate new KGs: LLMs have been used to extract triples from scientific literature
- [GNN for drug-disease predictions](http://txgnn.org/)

However, we are still using the KG as an intermediate information representation

---

## (Raw Take): Maybe _Attention is all you need_? Transformers may just directly generate the prioritized drug list for each disease

---
## Independent of the approach, scalability, bias, explainability and verifiability remain hard problems

- Scalability issues with growing biomedical data when KG representation remains
- Data bias affecting predictions
- Lack of explainability ("black box" problem)
- Limited integration of real-world data

Most of all: **Generating predictions is easy, verifying if they are correct is hard**



---

## Conclusions: 

1. KGs broke the silos. Good!
2. But we are hitting their limitations: Manual curation, thinking in IDs, missing continuous data
3. Foundation Models might be a total replacement, rather than just a Turbo Charger we tack onto it
4. But unless you solve the verification problem all you have is a black box
