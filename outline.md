        *   **Data Bias**: Many algorithms are susceptible to biases present in the data, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions.
        *   **Lack of Explainability**: Traditional machine learning models often function as "black boxes," making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions, a crucial aspect for clinical adoption.
        *   **Limited Real-World Data Integration**: Many KGs primarily rely on structured databases and may not fully leverage the wealth of information available in electronic health records (EHRs) and scientific literature.
## Part 2: Transition - The Need for a Paradigm Shift
*   **The Rise of Foundation Models: Towards a New Era of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning** 
    *   Introduce the concept of foundation models, specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs), as a potential paradigm shift in biomedical knowledge representation and reasoning. 
    *   While the provided sources offer limited information on foundation models in drug discovery, position them as a natural progression from traditional KGs, capable of addressing some of their limitations.
    *   Emphasize their potential advantages:
        *   **Enhanced Scalability**: LLMs can handle massive datasets, potentially encompassing the entirety of biomedical knowledge.
        *   **Improved Generalizability**:  Foundation models learn general representations of knowledge, allowing them to adapt to new domains and tasks more effectively than traditional methods.
        *   **Inherent Ability to Capture Context and Relationships**:  LLMs excel at understanding and representing relationships between entities in text, making them well-suited for knowledge-intensive domains like biomedicine.
*   **Bridging the Chasm to Real-World Applications**
    *   Highlight the need to move beyond research-focused applications and leverage the power of foundation models to address real-world challenges in drug discovery and repurposing.
    *   Emphasize the importance of incorporating real-world data from EHRs, clinical trials, and patient registries to develop more personalized and effective treatments.
    *   Introduce efforts to integrate LLMs with KGs, such as using LLMs for knowledge extraction from unstructured text to enrich existing KGs or to generate new knowledge graphs.
*   **Explainable AI and User-Centric Design for Trust and Adoption**
    *   Emphasize the crucial role of explainable AI in building trust and facilitating the adoption of foundation models in clinical settings.
    *   Highlight tools and techniques that provide human-understandable explanations for model predictions, allowing clinicians to understand the reasoning behind treatment recommendations. 
    *   Showcase examples like TxGNN Explainer, which generates interpretable explanations for drug repurposing predictions.  
    *   Stress the importance of user-centric design in developing tools and interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use for clinicians and researchers, drawing inspiration from the development of TxGNN Explorer.
