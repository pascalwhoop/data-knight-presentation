## Meetup outline
20:15 - 20:45 | Talk 2: Using Knowledge Graphs in Drug Discovery and Repurposing
Speaker: Pascal Brokmeier
Abstract: This presentation examines the evolving role of biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) and the disruptive potential of foundation models. It will explore current KG practices and how transformer-based models could revolutionize or even replace traditional KG approaches in biomedical research.
About Pascal: Head of Engineering at Every Cure, Pascal is dedicated to building platforms that identify existing drugs for repurposing to treat rare diseases. With a background at McKinsey & Company’s Quantum Black / AI practice, he has pioneered GenAI integration across multiple projects.


## Questions of the audience

1.	What are Knowledge Graphs?
•	How do knowledge graphs work, and how are they structured in the context of drug discovery?
2.	How are Knowledge Graphs used in Drug Repurposing?
•	Can you explain how knowledge graphs help identify drugs for repurposing?
•	What makes this method more effective than traditional drug discovery processes?
3.	Practical Examples of Knowledge Graphs in Action
•	Could you provide real-world examples where knowledge graphs have successfully led to the discovery of new treatments or the repurposing of existing drugs?
4.	Integration of AI with Knowledge Graphs
•	How does AI interact with knowledge graphs in this process?
•	What role does machine learning play in building and analyzing these graphs?
5.	Challenges in Implementing Knowledge Graphs for Drug Repurposing
•	What are the biggest technical or data-related challenges you’ve faced while using knowledge graphs in drug discovery?
6.	Impact on Rare Diseases
•	How effective has this approach been in addressing treatments for rare diseases?
•	How does Every Cure ensure that these discoveries are aligned with patient needs, especially in rare or underserved areas?
7.	Collaboration Between Industry and Research Institutions
•	How do you collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, universities, or public institutions to expand and refine the knowledge graphs?
8.	Data Quality and Source Verification
•	How do you ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data sources used in building these knowledge graphs?
9.	Scalability and Future Potential
•	How scalable is this approach? Could it eventually be used across broader disease categories or other areas in healthcare?
10.	Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy
•	How do you handle ethical considerations and ensure data privacy when working with sensitive patient data in the context of knowledge graphs?
